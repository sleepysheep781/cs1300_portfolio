                                So we added a black border to distinguish the demo section from the home page.

                    <h4>(1) Errors made</h4>
                        <li>User A completed the task without any error. But we found an interesting point. 
                            Every time he performed a new task, he would go back to the home page first. This may be his own usage habit.</li>
                        <li>User B completed the task without any error. But she was confused by the task of trying the website demo. 
                            She didn’t know if she had completed this task.</li>
                        <li>User C thought the prototype should be fully-functional. Therefore, for the task of trying the website demo,
                             she didn't know where the demo ended. For the task of viewing the template library, 
                             she expected that she could scroll down the page or enter a keyword to search for the intended template. 
                             For the task of creating the website, she thought she could truly add elements for the customized website. 
                             However, the prototype only displays key functions, which are not truly implemented.</li>

                                The average time to complete the task was 02:25 which is not as expected. 
                                We thought the reasons for users to take such a long time to complete this task are: 
                                (1) The users need time to be familiar with the website. 
                                (2) Our instruction of the task is not clear so they don’t know whether they complete the task or not.

                <p class="block">
                    In this project, I worked in a group of 4 to design an interface for an emerging startup. 
                    I went through the whole process of simulating a solution for a startup's concept. 
                    This experience also honed my collaboration and communication skills.
