                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="block">For this project, I first selected an existing website, 
                then analyzed it and identified its flaws based on usability and accessibility criteria. 
                Next, I redesigned the website to address the usability issues detected in the previous step, 
                and then created low-fi and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes. 
                In the end, I built a responsive website based on these prototypes.

                <h2>Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
                    <div class="block"> 
                        <h3>1. Picking a Web page </h3>
                        <p>The chosen website is the ordering website of <a href="https://www.chongqinghouse.net/">Chong Qing House.</a></p>
                        <p>Why choose it? This site is accessible to anyone, but it's not that popular. Dishes at Chong Qing House taste good, 
                            but its ordering site is hard to use. So I want to redesign it.
                        </p>
                    </div>
        
                    <div class="block"> 
                        <h3>2. Finding Problems</h3>
                        <div class="block"> 
                        <h4>(1) The layout design violates aesthetic and minimalist design principles.</h4>
                        <p>Currently there are multiple navbars and everything is displayed on one page. 
                            It is best to integrate category and cart items into the navigation bar, 
                            so that users can access different web pages in the navigation bar.
                        </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="block"> 
                        <h4>(2) The page doesn't provide enough help and documentation. </h4>
                        <p> For example, I have no idea about the difference between Vegetable Egg Rolls and Shanghai Spring Rolls. 
                            Both of them are rolls and share the same price. I don't know which one to order. 
                            Another example is the absence of a search bar. If I want to order Double Pork, 
                            I need to look in the long dish list, which is quite annoying.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="block"> 
                        <h4>(3) Photo album. </h4>
                        <p>
                            Some photos have captions with the name of the dish, while most images don't. 
                            There are even several identical images.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="block"> 
                        <h4>(4) The Menu page doesn’t minimize user’s memory load. </h4>
                        <p>
                            There is only text for each dish. 
                            The corresponding image is in another page. If the user want to know what Wonto Soup looks like, 
                            he need to recall or look at the image in the Photo album page and then go back to order. 
                            Instead, if a user click the name of a dish, it would be better to display its image and order options.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The payment methods shown in the pictures 
                            are credit card and cash, while the payment methods indicated by the text are WeChat, Alipay, credit card and BOA transfer.

                        <p>
                            The website doesn’t allow users to tailor frequent actions. 
                            There is no option for user to perform the same order as last time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           If the user clicks the delete button by mistake, 
                           there is no confirmation message before the action is performed. 
                        </p>

                            <p>Adding alternative text to image is important. Because it can pass the content of an image to a blind person 
                                using a screen reader. It is useful for a sighted person when the image fails to load. 
                                It is also used for search engine trying to understand the content of a web page.

                                the contrast ratio between text and its background should be at least 4.5:1. 
                                In the main Menu part, the background color is #FAD3C7, the text color is #E04406,
