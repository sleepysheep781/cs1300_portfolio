                    In this project, I used React to create a list-based interface with filtering, sorting and aggregator.

                <h2>Goal and Value of the Application</h2>
                <p class="block">This application aims to implement the online shopping service for a bakery. 
                    Users can filter items by the combination of 2 filtering categories (Types and Dietary Restrictions). 
                    Users can also sort items by price or calories in descending order. 
                    Users can add items to the shopping cart, get the total price and easily increase or decrease 
                    the quantity of items in the cart.</p>

                    <div class="block"> 
                        <h3>1. Aesthetic and minimalist design </h3>
                        <p>The page doesn't have any irrelevant information and consists of header name, filtering form, 
                            sorting dropdown, image gallery, and shopping-cart aggregator. Each part has a different color 
                            so that users can distinguish them.
                        </p>

                    <div class="block"> 
                        <h3>2. Visibility of system status</h3>
                        <p>The page always keeps users informed about what is going on with appropriate titles.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="block"> 
                        <h3>3. Consistency and standards</h3>
                        <p>The application is designed with consistent styling such as font size, font color, font style, image display, etc.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="block">

                    <div class="block"> 
                        <h3>5. User control and freedom</h3>
                        <p>The shopping cart supports undo and redo. Users can easily add to or remove from the cart.</p>

                        <p>Following real-world conventions, the application speaks users' language with words, icons, concepts familiar to users. 
                            For example, a radio button indicates a single selection, while a checkbox allows multiple selections.</p>

                            and filters the same ones. "Dietary Restrictions" allows multiple selections. When users select any radio button,

                            if the value doesn't exist in the set, add it to the set, otherwise, remove it from the set.

                <p class="block">
                    In this project, I learned how to use React for web development. I used interface components,
                    and tie the components to an internal data state to update the data. I also applied
                    some useful React hooks to "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.
                    Hooks used include useState, useEffect, and useCallback.
